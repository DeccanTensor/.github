### 📡 The Mission: Reversing Entropy

**Deccan Tensor Labs** operates at the intersection of thermodynamics and software architecture. We believe that the digital universe naturally tends toward disorder (bloat, latency, complexity). Our mandate is to reverse this process.

We forge **Artifacts** and **Protocols** designed for the Agentic Web—tools that are lightweight, strongly typed, and mathematically precise.

> *"We don't just write software; we structure reality."*

### 🧪 Current Research & Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Classification | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[toon-py](https://github.com/Deccan-Tensor/toon-py)** | 🟢 **Active** | `Protocol` | Reference implementation for **Python**. The core serializer. |
| **[toon-dotnet](https://github.com/Deccan-Tensor/toon-dotnet)** | 🟠 **In Dev** | `Protocol` | Native **C# / .NET** implementation for enterprise ecosystems. |
| **[toon-vscode](https://github.com/Deccan-Tensor/toon-vscode)** | 🟡 **Planned** | `Tooling` | IDE Syntax highlighting and intelligence for `.toon` files. |

### 🧬 The Stack

We build with high-fidelity tools for high-velocity results.

* **Core:** `Python 3.10+`, `C# .NET 8`
* **Engine:** `Rust` (Planned for v2.0 Core)
* **Domain:** `LLM Optimization`, `Data Serialization`, `Agentic Systems`
* **Philosophy:** Zero Dependency, Type Safety, Low Latency.
